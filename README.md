Working my way through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html)
using [mit-scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) v12.1.

## Notes

### Chapter 1

Working through Chapter 1 has shown that there are some gaps in my math background.

**Exercise 1.22**

SICP 2nd Edition requests that the time to process each prime be noted.  When the
book was published circa 1996 the time required to test primes >1M was probably
significant. Running this example in 2024 on a 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro the time to
process primes was effectively < .01 seconds. I had to run the test routine
against primes >1B to see any actual duration reported.
